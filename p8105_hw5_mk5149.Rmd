# Preparation
Load any necessary packages.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Problem 1
We set a random seed to ensure our simulation results are reproducible. 
```{r}
set.seed(42) # Set seed for reproducible results
```

This function `bday_sim` takes a group size `n_room` as input, samples `n_room` birthdays from 1 to 365, and returns `TRUE` if a duplicate birthday is found and `FALSE` otherwise.
```{r}
bday_sim = function(n_room){
  # Sample n_room birthdays from 1:365 with replacement
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)
  
  # Check if the number of unique birthdays is less than the group size
  # If it is, a duplicate must exist.
  repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room
  
  # Return the logical result
  repeated_bday
}
```
